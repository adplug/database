Official AdPlug Database
------------------------
The official AdPlug database is the authoritative source for AdPlug to
get additional, essential replay information about problematic
files. Some file formats contain too few information about a song for
it to be correctly replayed by AdPlug. To counter this, the AdPlug
database was created.

The official AdPlug database at one day should contain the information
needed about all problematic files. If you got a problematic file
that is not covered in this database, please file a bug report against
the database and include either the problematic file itself or the
corresponding database entry.

Installation instructions
-------------------------
Copy the file 'adplug.db' into a directory, where it can reside
permanently and configure your AdPlug frontend to its location. UNIX
clients usually come pre-configured with '$HOME/.adplug' as the
directory to put the file into. The Winamp and DOS frontends usually
look in their installation directories for the file, by default.
